 This is a program I put together for a school project, now trying to put it out there for people to use and/or play with.
 
Essentially its a Neural Network C++ program made primarily from a fellow named David Miller's online tutorial in a Qt Gui Enviroment, and is able to generate a model given a series of inputs and expected outputs.
 
This is very much so a beta version and currently from just interacting with the Gui all it can do is make a mySQL connection and produce a model in the form of a json file based off a txt file training set.

The training set must be in the format of the following:

  topology: inputlayer hiddenlayer1 outputlayer
  
  in: data1 data2 data3 ect..
  
  out: expectedoutput1 expectedoutput2 expectedoutput3 ect..
  
  I am working to put this together and give credits where neccesary and figure out licensing ASAP so for all those who put together some of the libraries I am using and dont see proper credit where due please wait ! Or message me, I am in the middle of exams right now and am still trying to figure this all out.
  
  Thank you !!
